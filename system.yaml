    notes: >
      Hello World. Today was the first commit, and the day of the creation of
      this structure. These ideas have been flowing in my mind over the past
      week, and accumulating, so I needed a way to make it real. Something to
      make it official, and give it a concrete foundation before involving
      others. Since this is a new type of institution, that instantiation could
      not be done using a standard existing method. So I chose this one - a Git
      repo with a .yaml file. With this document, the Prosperity Module system
      is now real. I am now leading both the MetaModule and the Bunyala Module.
      There are only two roles at the moment - the leadership of the MetaModule,
      and the leadership of the Bunyala Module. But the number of roles will
      grow, and the system will become more complex with time. Not to get too
      emotional in the logs, but I have high hopes for this system. I hope many
      others share in the dream with me, and it becomes something far larger
      than what one person can do alone. Now, the seed is planted. May this
      file, and the real system it represents, grow into a strong tree and serve
      us well.
